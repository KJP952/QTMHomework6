    #/explain
    # The provided Python code defines a function named fibonacci that generates a list of Fibonacci numbers up to the nth term.
    # The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.
    # The function takes one argument n, which is the number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence that the function will generate.
    # The function begins by checking if n is less than or equal to 0. If it is, the function returns an empty list, as a Fibonacci sequence of zero or negative length doesn't make sense.
    # Next, the function checks if n is 1. If it is, the function returns a list containing only the number 0, which is the first number in the Fibonacci sequence.
    # The function then checks if n is 2. If it is, the function returns a list containing the first two numbers of the Fibonacci sequence, 0 and 1.
    # If n is greater than 2, the function creates a list fib initialized with the first two numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.
    # It then enters a loop that starts from 2 and ends at n (exclusive). For each iteration of the loop, the function appends the sum of the last two numbers in the fib list to the end of the list. This is the key step that generates each new number in the Fibonacci sequence.
    # Finally, the function returns the fib list, which now contains the first n numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.

#Copilot's documentation
#' Calculate the factorial of a number
#'
#' This function calculates the factorial of a given number `n`. The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`.
#' It uses a recursive approach, where the factorial of `n` is calculated as `n` times the factorial of `n - 1`.
#' The base case for the recursion is `n = 0`, where the factorial is defined as 1.
#'
#' @param n A non-negative integer for which the factorial is to be calculated.
#' @return The factorial of the input number `n`.
#' @examples
#' calculate_factorial(5) # returns 120
#' calculate_factorial(0) # returns 1

#Question 7
def normalize_data(data):
    min_val = min(data)

    return [(x - min_val) / (max_val - min_val) for x in data]

#/explain gives
#The provided Python code defines a function named normalize_data that normalizes a list of numerical data. 
#Normalization is a scaling technique used in data preprocessing where values are shifted and rescaled so that they end up ranging between 0 and 1. It is useful in some machine learning algorithms when your data has varying scales and the algorithm you are using does not make assumptions about the distribution of your data, such as k-nearest neighbors and artificial neural networks.
#The function takes one argument data, which is expected to be a list of numerical values.
#Inside the function, it first calculates the minimum value min_val in the data list using the built-in min function. Then it calculates the maximum value max_val in the data list using the built-in max function.
#The function then returns a new list that is created by a list comprehension. The list comprehension iterates over each value x in the data list. For each x, it calculates the normalized value as (x - min_val) / (max_val - min_val). This is the formula for min-max normalization, which scales the data to a fixed range - usually 0 to 1.
#The result is a new list where all the values have been normalized to fall between 0 and 1, inclusive. If the data list is empty, the function will return an empty list.
